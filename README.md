# Face Generation using GAN

This is my project submission for the Deep Learning Foundation Nanodegree from Udacity.

In this project, I use a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate new images of faces.

You can view my work and the model accuracy directly downloading and opening the html file.

The project uses two datasets in this project:
- [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
- [CelebA](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html)

You will have to download the data if you wish to run the notebook.

I use floyd to train the model. More on floyd at https://www.floydhub.com. But you can use AWS or other environments with GPUs to train the model.
